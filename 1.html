                    <p>The full body sensation you get, starting in your lower back that <em>lurches</em> you forward. I missed the toilet.</p>
                    <p>…</p>
                    <p>Customers mumbling and scuffing their feet above me. Ugh. My head spins: vision doubling. </p>
                    <p>Frantic knocks on the door. “YO-” my coworker leaves a toothbrush and overly sweetened coffee outside. And darts back upstairs.</p>
                    <p>All I can focus on is the bitter scolding echoing from my earbuds… </p>
                    <p>“-you smoking <em>weed</em> was like you <strong>cheating</strong> on me!”</p>
                    <p>here comes another round but I can barely see the toilet. </p>
                    <p>Shaking is my next breath as I wipe the sludge off my mouth. </p>
                    <p>“-I’ll never forgive u. Goodbye.” ** click**</p>
                    <p>Curling into a ball on the freezing crusty tiles. My vision shrinks again. Bile swims around my mouth.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>This isn’t the most complex painting to understand.</p>
                    <p>In retrospect all is fair in love and ***war. No point in further airing out dirty laundry though. </p>
                    <p>This painting was many months in the making as I wanted my hard work over the years (of writing these letters) to be memorialized in something beautiful, other than memories.</p>
                    <p><strong>Absolution, kind of like a forgiveness and release in one (+ bonus of being a religious term. </strong>) </p>
                    <p>At the end of the day this painting is for me. It is absolution. </p>
